# Sentiment Analysis
Here I have used RNN(recurrent neural network) with word Embeddings and LSTM to generate if a sequence of review is Positive or Negative.

I will implement my code in both Pytorch and Tensorflow framework.

My work in inspired from Andrej Karpathy's char rnn implementation in Pytorch.
The work is heavily based on the Udacity's Sentiment analysis exercise. I have implemented with a changed architecture 
giving better results.
