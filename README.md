# Sentiment Analysis
Here I have used RNN(recurrent neural network) with word Embeddings and LSTM to generate if a sequence of review is Positive or Negative.

I will implement my code in both Pytorch and Tensorflow framework.

My work in inspired from Andrej Karpathy's char rnn implementation in Pytorch.
